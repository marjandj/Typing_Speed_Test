This is a desktop application built with Python and Tkinter that measures how quickly and accurately a user can type a set of randomly generated words.
The main window contains two text boxes: one with a block of randomly generated words that the user should type, and another, initially empty, where the user enters their text. 
A Start button begins a countdown timer of one minute. Once the timer starts, the user types the displayed words into the input box. After the timer ends, a popup window appears showing the results, including the number of words correctly typed, the user's words-per-minute (WPM) score, and the full text the user typed during the test.
This app is a simple and effective tool for improving typing speed and accuracy.
